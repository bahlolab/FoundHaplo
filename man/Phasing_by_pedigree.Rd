\title{Phase samples with a disease variant by pedigrees}
\usage{
Phasing_by_pedigree(input_vcf, dir_output, sample_info_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_vcf}{Path to a VCF file  (type \code{"character"})}

\item{dir_output}{Directory path to a directory to save the output VCF files (type \code{"character"})}

\item{sample_info_file}{Path to a tab delimitted .txt file with sample names and type of phasing to be used included in a new line, include sample names as in the VCF file in mentioned order.
For the type "trio", affected-offspring,affected-parent,unaffected-parent trio
For the type "duo" or "related", affected-offspring,affected-parent,unaffected-parent duo
"duo" and "related" works similarly (type \code{"character"})}
}
\value{
Write a valid new VCF file in dir_output "h1" column contains the disease haplorype saved as homozygous genotypes.
}
\description{
Takes a VCF file with at least two known disease individuals and create disease haplotypes based on trio/duo or related data.
}
\details{
Make sure the input_vcf chromosome column doesn't have the "chr" prefix.
Loading ANNOVAR files to annotate population freqencies takes most of the time and advised to load them to R and run the rest of the code in the function to create disease haplotypes.
