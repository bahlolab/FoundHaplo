Any number of test individuals can be tested using multiple disease haplotypes across multiple disease variants. FoundHaplo tests a pair of individuals independantly and outputs individual log likelihood ratios of identity by descent sharing.

The statistic FoundHaplo score (FH score) is the combined log likelihood ratios of identity by descent sharing which is taken to be the maximum of individual log likelihood ratios for a single individual of interest across all disease haplotypes for a single disease variant. Individuals with a FH score greater than a defined critical threshold value are predicted to carry the disease-causing variant of interest.
